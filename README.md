## Data availability
All data and code needed to reproduce the analysis and plots regarding metabolomics can be found within the /data and /code folders of this github repository

## Code summary
Several notebooks are provided, showing the analysis presented in the paper and how the figures were generated.

## Installation and system requirements
Python packages used for analysis  
All code written for this program was in python 3.7.2  

Python version: 3.7.2  
Python packages included:  
numpy [v 1.16.0]  
scipy [v 1.2.0]  
pandas [v 0.24.0]  
sklearn [v 0.20.3]  
matplotlib [v 3.0.2]  
statsmodels [v 0.10.1]  
seaborn [0.9.0]  

### System requirements
Code was written and execuded on a MacBookPro  

CPU: Intel Core i5  
Memory: 8GB  
Graphics: Intel Iris Graphics 6100  
MacOS: 10.14.3  
### Installation instructions
All python packages should be easily being installed via pip [https://pypi.org/project/pip/]
